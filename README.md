# sei35_project-1
Deployed to netlify https://the-match.netlify.app/

## Technologies Used
Coded using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript on Visual Studio Code.
Codes are published to Github.

## Approach Taken
Came up with the brief UI design on the concept of the game.
Created the brief layout in HTML and CSS first and top it up with Vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the DOM elements for interactivity.

## Concept
- Memorize the colours and numbers of the 4 boxes in each challenge within 5 seconds and match them by drag-and-drop the colours and numbers options to the empty boxes.
- Get (a) 5 points for correct match of either all colours OR numbers; (b) 10 points for correct match of both colours AND numbers.

## Unsolved problem/ Enhancement for future releases
- Increase complexity of the game by adding more boxes, colours or numbers.
- Add animation effect, background music/sound effect to enhance the experience
- Make it mobile responsive
